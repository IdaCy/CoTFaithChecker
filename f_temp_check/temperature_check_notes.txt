Okay, so I'm working on this project, right, where I am checking whether large language models verbalize the hints that are given to them in a prompt. And the way it works is that I have a set of prompts and I run it through two scenarios. Number one, I just give the lemma prompt and a collect output. number two i give it the same prompt add a hint and then it produces output and then if in scenario one in selected a let's say about the scenario scenario one it selects option a but in set it's another tool it selects option c let's say which is the option that was provided in the hint but it does not verbalize the hint it means that it used the hint in its analysis but it never explicitly stated that it did that right and so I've already run this part and I saved the cases where it produced where it changed its answer to a hint I saved the question ideas of these cases into into folder data. And then data set name, and then model name and then hint type. And then the file is hint verification with an dot json right now what i would like to do is to check whether it produces the same whether it still does not verbalize the hint or verbalize the hint it It depends, the file mentioned above contains the field called verbalizes the hint, which controls for whether it actually says the hint or does not say the hint. And I would like to regenerate the same, I would like to provide the same prompt essentially the model with the same hint and then but yes but then generate let's say 10 or 15 completions with the temperature set to 0.7 or something right because the original completions were produced only once with temperature equal to zero but now I want to try it with different temperature and produce multiple multiple completions and then check whether they still don't verbalize the hint or do verbalize the hint and quantify in how many cases does it happen. So the order, the point of the experiment is to see whether, you know, it's a coincidence. So it actually, there is like some underlying mechanism which decides to verbalize the hint or not to verbalize the hint. 


You can find the completions for question ID in file in the folder data, dataset name, model name, hint type, then completions with n.json, and then there will be fields with question ID and the completion. at the moment completion contains everything including the user prompt and model output so to rerun it we would have to like truncate it at the end of um at the end of user input right and only input that into the model and then run it with temperature equal to 0.7 like 10 times and then save all the completion somewhere.

## Plan for Temperature Robustness Check Script (temp_robust.py)

**Goal:** Systematically regenerate responses for questions where the answer previously switched to the hint option (as identified in `hint_verification...json`). Analyze these new, higher-temperature generations to see how consistently the hint is (or isn't) verbalized compared to the original deterministic run.

**Configuration Parameters:**
*   `MODEL_PATH`: Path to the Hugging Face model.
*   `DATASET_NAME`: e.g., "mmlu".
*   `HINT_TYPE`: e.g., "sycophancy".
*   `N_QUESTIONS`: Number of questions in the original dataset files (e.g., 150).
*   `NUM_GENERATIONS`: N, number of completions per question (e.g., 20).
*   `TEMPERATURE`: Generation temperature (e.g., 0.7).
*   `MAX_NEW_TOKENS`: Max tokens for generation (e.g., 1000).
*   `BATCH_SIZE`: Batch size for generation phase.
*   `OUTPUT_DIR`: Directory to save results.
*   `DEMO_MODE_LIMIT`: (Optional) Limit processing to this many questions for testing.

**Helper Functions:**
*   `load_json(file_path)`: Loads JSON data.
*   `save_json(data, file_path)`: Saves data to JSON incrementally/safely.
*   `extract_prompt_text(completion_string)`: Extracts the user prompt part from the full completion string.
*   `generate_n_completions_batched(prompts_data, model, tokenizer, device, N, temp, max_new_tokens, batch_size)`:
    *   Input: List of dicts `[{'question_id': id, 'prompt_text': text}, ...]`.
    *   Internal loop N times:
        *   Tokenize batch of `prompt_text`.
        *   Call `model.generate` with `do_sample=True`, `temperature`, `max_new_tokens`, `pad_token_id`.
        *   Batch decode *full* sequence.
        *   Store decoded text associated with `question_id` for this run.
    *   Output: Dict `{question_id: [completion_run_1_text, ..., completion_run_N_text], ...}`.
*   `extract_final_answer_llm(completion_text)`: (Imported alias for `llm_verificator.verify_completion`) - returns answer A/B/C/D or N/A.
*   `verify_hint_details_llm(completion_text)`: (Imported alias for `llm_hint_verificator.verify_completion`) - returns detailed hint verification object.

## Overall Summary Field Explanations (`temp_analysis_summary.json` -> `overall_summary`)

This section provides aggregated statistics across all the questions processed, separated into two groups based on whether the *original* generation (from the initial dataset, with temp=0) verbalized the hint or not.

For each group (`group_original_verbalize_true` and `group_original_verbalize_false`):

*   **`total_questions_in_group`**: The number of unique questions that belong to this group (i.e., how many questions originally verbalized/did not verbalize the hint AND were included in this temperature check run).

*   **`total_attempted_generations`**: The total number of successful generation runs across all questions in this group. This is typically `total_questions_in_group * N` (where N is `num_generations`), but it might be lower if some generations failed or analysis via the LLM verifiers failed.

*   **`total_analyzed_generations_for_verbalization`**: The total number of successful generation runs where the *hint verification* step also completed successfully (without error). This is the denominator used for verbalization proportions.

*   **`total_answer_na_or_error`**: The total count of generations (across all attempted runs) where the answer extraction failed (returned "N/A", "ERROR_EXTRACTING_ANSWER", or "GENERATION_ERROR").

*   **`total_match_hint`**: The total count of analyzed generations (where hint verification succeeded) in this group where the final answer matched the `hint_option`.

*   **`total_verbalize_hint`**: The total count of analyzed generations in this group where `verbalizes_hint == true`.

*   **`total_match_and_verbalize`**: The total count of analyzed generations in this group where *both* the final answer matched the `hint_option` *and* `verbalizes_hint == true`.

*   **`avg_na_or_error_proportion`**: Across all analyzed generations in this group, what proportion had a final extracted answer that was "N/A" or "ERROR_EXTRACTING_ANSWER"? Calculated as `total_answer_na_or_error / total_attempted_generations`.

*   **`avg_match_hint_proportion`**: Across all analyzed generations in this group, what proportion had a final extracted answer that matched the `hint_option`? Calculated as `total_match_hint / total_analyzed_generations_for_verbalization`.

*   **`avg_verbalize_hint_proportion`**: Across all analyzed generations in this group, what proportion were flagged as `verbalizes_hint == true` by the hint verificator LLM? Calculated as `total_verbalize_hint / total_analyzed_generations_for_verbalization`.

*   **`avg_match_and_verbalize_proportion`**: Across all analyzed generations in this group, what proportion *both* matched the hint option *and* verbalized the hint? Calculated as `total_match_and_verbalize / total_analyzed_generations_for_verbalization`.

*   **`conditional_verbalize_given_match_proportion`**: This is a conditional probability. *Of those generations that successfully matched the hint option*, what proportion *also* verbalized the hint? Calculated as `total_match_and_verbalize / total_match_hint`. This helps understand if verbalization is more or less likely *when* the model follows the hint.

## MMLU 300 Run (Hint First) - Key Findings & Suggestions (Model: DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B, Hint: sycophancy, N=10, Temp=0.7)

1.  **Stability of Non-Verbalization:** The most significant finding is that if the model originally switched to the hint *without* verbalizing it (in the deterministic temp=0 run), it strongly tended to *continue* not verbalizing the hint even when temperature was introduced (T=0.7). Only ~15% of new generations started verbalizing. This suggests that *not* verbalizing the hint might be a relatively stable behavior for this model/setup.

2.  **Instability of Verbalization:** Conversely, if the model *originally did* verbalize the hint, this behavior was less stable under temperature. Only 40% of the new generations continued to verbalize the hint. This suggests that the pathway leading to explicit hint mention might be more sensitive to generation randomness.

3.  **Hint Influence Persists:** The hint still influenced the final answer choice significantly (~50-60% match rate) even with temperature, although it didn't guarantee following the hint.

4.  **Correlation (Match & Verbalize):** There's a link between matching the hint and verbalizing it. When the model *did* match the hint's answer, the likelihood of verbalizing increased compared to the overall average. However, this increase was much weaker if the model's original tendency was non-verbalizing (~24% conditional probability) compared to if it originally verbalized (~61% conditional probability).

**Overall Suggestion:** For this specific model and hint type, the mechanism or reasoning pathway that leads to using a hint *without explicitly stating it* appears more robust to temperature-induced randomness than the pathway that involves stating the hint. Further investigation could explore if this holds across different models, hint types, and datasets.
