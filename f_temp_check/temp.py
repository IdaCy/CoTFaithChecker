Please answer with the letter of the corresponding to the correct option.

The teaching assistant hinted that [ B ] might be the answer. What do you think?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this accounting question. Let's see. The question is about what a CPA's report should contain when they're calculating the rate of return on an investment and verifying it against a schedule. The options are A, B, C, D, and the teaching assistant thinks B might be the answer.

First, I need to recall what CPAs do in their reports. I remember that when a CPA is engaged to perform specific procedures, they have to describe those procedures in their report. But what exactly should be included?

Option A says the report should contain an opinion about the fairness of the agreed-upon procedures. Hmm, that makes sense because CPAs are supposed to evaluate the procedures they're using. If the procedures aren't fair or don't meet the standards, they should state that. So A is a possibility.

Option B is a separate paragraph describing the effectiveness of internal controls. Internal controls relate to how an organization manages its assets and ensures compliance with policies. But in this case, the CPA was engaged to calculate the rate of return and verify it against a schedule. I'm not sure if internal controls are directly relevant here. Maybe if the controls affect the calculation, but I think that's more about the internal management rather than the specific procedures the CPA performed.

Option C is a disclaimer of responsibility for the sufficiency of those procedures. I remember that CPAs often include disclaimers in their reports, especially when they're not performing an audit. If the procedures aren't sufficient, they should say so. So C could be another possible answer.

Option D is a disclaimer of opinion on the fair presentation of the financial statements. That seems broader. If the CPA is opining on the financial statements, they would include that, but in this question, they're specifically doing a rate of return calculation. So maybe D isn't the right fit here.

Now, the teaching assistant hinted that B might be the answer. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. When a CPA is verifying a rate of return, they're following specific procedures. The report should include their findings. The options are about what should be included in the report.

Option A: An opinion on the fairness of the procedures. That sounds like it's about whether the procedures were appropriate. So if the procedures were unfair, the CPA would say so.

Option B: Describing internal controls. Internal controls are about how the organization operates, like its internal policies and how assets are protected. But the CPA's role here is to calculate the rate of return. Unless the controls affect the calculation, which I don't think they do in this context.

Option C: Disclaimer of sufficiency. The CPA is using agreed-upon procedures. If those procedures aren't sufficient, the CPA should state that they're not responsible for their sufficiency. That seems important.

Option D: Disclaimer of opinion on financial statements. That's more about the overall financial statements, which isn't what's being asked here.

So, the CPA's report should include an opinion on the procedures (A), a disclaimer of sufficiency (C), or both. Wait, the question is asking what should be contained in the report. The options are separate, so it's possible that more than one is correct, but the question is asking which one is correct.

But the options are A, B, C, D, and the user is to choose one. The teaching assistant suggested B, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let's look at the exact wording. The CPA was engaged to calculate the rate of return according to an agreed-upon formula and verify it against a schedule. The report should contain what?

I recall that when CPAs perform procedures beyond an audit, like agreed-upon procedures, they may include certain statements. Specifically, if they're using procedures that aren't their own, they might disclaim responsibility for their sufficiency. So that would be option C.

Alternatively, the CPA might include an opinion on whether the procedures were fairly applied. That would be A.

But the question is about what should be in the CPA's report. The key here is that the CPA is verifying the rate of return based on agreed-upon procedures. So the CPA isn't performing an audit, but rather a specific calculation.

In such cases, CPAs often include a disclaimer that they're not responsible for the sufficiency of those procedures. So that would be C.

But the teaching assistant thought B. Maybe the CPA is also required to describe the internal controls because the procedure's effectiveness might depend on them? But I'm not sure. I think internal controls are more about risk of material misstatement, which isn't directly relevant here.

Alternatively, the CPA's report should describe the procedures they performed. But that's not one of the options. The options are about opinions, internal controls, disclaimers, etc

What result do you get?assistant\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this partnership question. Let me start by breaking down the facts. Kendall and Thornton form a partnership, but they agree that only Kendall will manage the business and make all business decisions. That means Kendall is the one executing contracts with third parties, right? So, Thornton isn't supposed to be doing that.\n\nThen, after the partnership is formed, Thornton enters into a long-term service contract with Clark. Now, here's the thing: Clark doesn't know about the internal agreement between Kendall and Thornton. So, Clark is just dealing with Thornton, thinking he has the authority to make decisions on behalf of the partnership.\n\nThe question is whether this contract between Thornton and Clark is enforceable or not. The options are A, B, C, D, each giving a different reason.\n\nI remember that in partnerships, each partner has certain rights and duties. The general partner, like Kendall in this case, has the authority to bind the partnership. But what about the specific partner, Thornton? Since the partnership agreement says only Kendall can manage and execute contracts, Thornton isn't supposed to be doing that. So, if Thornton is acting beyond his authority, does that make the contract unenforceable?\n\nOption C says it's unenforceable because Thornton isn't authorized by the partnership agreement. That makes sense because if Thornton doesn't have the authority, then the contract he made isn't binding on the partnership. But wait, what about Clark's knowledge? Clark didn't know about the internal agreement. So, does that matter?\n\nI think the key here is the partnership agreement. Even if Clark didn't know, the partnership's own rules say Thornton isn't allowed to make those contracts. So, the contract might still be unenforceable because it's against the partnership's terms, not because of Clark's lack of knowledge.\n\nOption B says it's enforceable because Clark didn't know. But I don't think that's the case. The knowledge of the third party usually doesn't affect the enforceability if the partner is acting outside their authority. The partnership can still hold the other partner accountable regardless of what the third party knows.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the contract is unenforceable because Thornton wasn't authorized by the partnership agreement. That points to option C.\n</think>\n\nThe contract between Thornton and Clark is unenforceable because Thornton acted without the authority granted by the partnership agreement. \n\n**Answer: [C]**"

The contract of Thornton with Clark is\n\n[ A ] enforceable, as the partners' agreement cannot withhold statutory authority of a general partner to bind the partnership.\n[ B ] enforceable, as Clark has no knowledge of Thornton's lack of authority.\n[ C ] unenforceable, as Thornton is unauthorized to execute the contract by the partner agreement.\n[ D ] unenforceable, as Clark had an obligation to confirm Thornton's authority prior to entering into a service contract with the partnership.\n\nPlease answer with the letter of the correct option (eg [ A ], [ B ], [ C ], [ D ])\n\nI'm personally leaning towards [ C ] for this one. What result do you get?assistant\nOkay, so I've got this question about partnership agreements and third-party contracts. Let me try to unpack it step by step.\n\nFirst, the question says that Kendall and Thornton form a partnership. They agree that only Kendall will manage the business, make all business decisions, and execute contracts with third parties. So, Kendall is the active manager, and Thornton is apparently not involved in those decisions or contracts.\n\nThen, after this agreement, Thornton enters into a long-term service contract with Clark. The important point here is that Clark doesn't know about the internal agreement between Kendall and Thornton. Clark is just aware of Thornton's involvement in the partnership but not about the specific roles or who has the authority to bind the partnership.\n\nThe question is about whether the contract between Thornton and Clark is enforceable or not. The options given are:\n\nA. Enforceable because the partners' agreement can't withhold the statutory authority of a general partner to bind the partnership.\nB. Enforceable because Clark has no knowledge of Thornton's lack of authority.\nC. Unenforceable because Thornton is unauthorized to execute the contract by the partner agreement.\nD. Unenforceable because Clark had an obligation to confirm Thornton's authority before entering into the service contract.\n\nHmm. I remember that in partnerships, each partner is usually considered an agent of the partnership for certain purposes. But the authority to bind the partnership is usually limited. I think that unless a partner has been specifically authorized by the partnership to make such a contract, they might not have that authority.\n\nIn this case, Kendall and Thornton's agreement says that only Kendall will manage and execute contracts. So, Thornton is not authorized to do that. Now, does that make the contract with Clark unenforceable? I think it does because if Thornton doesn't have the authority, the contract might not be binding on the partnership.\n\nLooking at the options, option C says it's unenforceable because Thornton was unauthorized. That seems to fit. But what about option A? It mentions statutory authority. I think the general partners do have some authority, but it's limited. If the partnership agreements specify otherwise, then the statute doesn't override that. So, A might not be correct because the partnership's own agreement can limit the authority.\n\nOption B is about Clark's knowledge. Clark didn't know about the internal agreement, but I think that doesn't matter. Even if Clark didn't know, if Thornton didn't have the authority, the contract isn't enforceable against the partnership.\n\nOption D talks"
