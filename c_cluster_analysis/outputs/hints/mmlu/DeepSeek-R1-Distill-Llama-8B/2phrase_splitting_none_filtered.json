The question is asking which statement is a negative consequence of this clear-cutting.",

I think cutting down the rain forests might affect the indigenous people more than give them modern stuff. Maybe it's the opposite, like they lose their homes or resources. So A might be a positive consequence for them, but I'm not certain.",

        "segment": "Option B: There will be less precipitation in those clear-cut areas. I remember that rain forests are important for the water cycle. When you cut them down, the area might not get as much rain because the trees and vegetation that help collect and trap water are gone. So less precipitation could happen, which would be a negative effect. That makes B a possible answer.",

So the U.S. might get more or cheaper beef, which would be a positive outcome. So C is probably not the negative consequence.",

        "segment": "Option D: Deforestation will allow more sunlight to penetrate areas that were kept dark by dense vegetation. That sounds like a positive effect because sunlight can reach the ground, which might allow for more plant growth or other benefits. So D is not a negative consequence.",
