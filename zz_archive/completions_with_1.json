Let me read it again carefully.\n\nThe question says that there's a correlation of r = 0.9 between the number of hours per day students study and their GPAs. Then it asks which conclusion is reasonable, with four options: A, B, C, D.\n\nFirst, I remember that correlation measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables. So, r = 0.9 is a strong positive correlation, meaning as study hours increase, GPAs tend to increase as well.\n\nNow, let's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A: 90% of students who study receive high grades. Hmm, this sounds like it's making a cause-and-effect statement. But wait, correlation doesn't prove causation. Just because study hours are correlated with GPAs doesn't mean that more study hours cause higher grades. It could be that students who are more motivated or have better abilities are the ones studying more and getting higher grades. So, I'm not sure if A is necessarily correct.\n\nOption B: 90% of students who receive high grades study a lot. This seems like the converse of A. Again, it's making a cause-and-effect claim. If 90% of high-grade students study a lot, does that follow from the correlation? Well, a high correlation means that study hours and GPAs are closely related, but it doesn't specifically tell us that the majority of high grades are due to studying. It could be other factors. So, B might not be the right conclusion either.\n\nOption C: 90% of the variation in GPAs can be explained by variation in number of study hours per day. This is about the proportion of variance explained. I recall that the square of the correlation coefficient (r\u00b2) gives the proportion of variance in one variable that's explained by the other. So, r = 0.9, r\u00b2 = 0.81, which means 81% of the variation in GPAs is explained by study hours. So, C is saying 90%, which is higher than 81%, so that doesn't seem right.\n\nOption D: 81% of the variation in GPAs can be explained by variation in number of study hours per day. As I just thought, since r = 0.9, r\u00b2 = 0.81, so this is exactly what D is stating. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. The question is about the variation in GPAs explained by study hours. So, yes, the formula is r\u00b2 = variance of Y explained by X over variance of Y. So, 0.9 squared is 0.81, so 81% is correct. Therefore, D is the right answer.\n\nI think I got it. So, the conclusion that makes sense is D because it's directly related to the square of the correlation coefficient, which indicates the proportion of variance explained.\n</think>\n\nThe correct answer is D. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Understanding Correlation (r = 0.9):** A correlation of 0.9 indicates a strong positive linear relationship between study hours and GPA. As study hours increase, GPA tends to increase.\n\n2. **Evaluating Each Option:**\n   - **A and B:** These options make causal claims, which correlation doesn't support. Correlation doesn't prove causation.\n   - **C:** This suggests 90% of GPA variation is explained by study hours, but using r\u00b2 = 0.81, only 81% is explained.\n   - **D:** This correctly states that 81% of GPA variation is explained by study hours, aligning with r\u00b2 = 0.81.\n\n**Answer:** D<\uff5cend\u2581of\u2581sentence\uff5c>"
