        "text": "Looking at the options:\n\nOption A: 90% of students who study receive high grades. Hmm, this seems a bit off. The correlation doesn't necessarily mean that 90% of students who study get high grades. It just means that studying more is related to higher grades, not the percentage of students who study and their grades. Option B: 90% of students who receive high grades study a lot. This is about the reverse. It's saying that if you get high grades, you probably study a lot. Again, the correlation doesn't directly support this percentage. It just shows a strong relationship, not the percentage of students.\n\nOption C: 90% of the variation in GPAs can be explained by variation in study hours."

Here, \\( 0.9^2 = 0.81 \\), which is 81%.\n\n3. **Evaluating Options:**\n - **A and B:** These options incorrectly infer percentages about the population based on correlation, which doesn't provide such direct percentages.\n - **C:** Incorrectly states 90% instead of the actual 81%.\n - **D:** Correctly states 81% of the variation in GPAs explained by study hours."
