        "text": "h is the measure of how much the two variables vary together. The maximum value for r is 1, so 0.9 is quite high. But does that translate to 90% of the variation? I think the coefficient itself doesn't directly represent the percentage of variation explained. Instead, the coefficient squared (r\u00b2) gives the proportion of variance explained. So, 0.9 squared is 0.81, which is 81%. So, option C is saying 90%, which is higher than the actual 81%, so that's incorrect.\n\nOption D: 81% of the variation in GPAs can be explained by study hours. As I just thought, since r is 0.9, r\u00b2 is 0.81, which is 81%. So, this seems correct because it's directly derived from the correlation coefficient. The question is about variation in GPAs explained by study hours, and 81% makes sense here.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. The question says \"variation in GPAs can be explained by variation in number of study hours per day.\" So, yes, that's exactly what r\u00b2 tells us. So, 81% is the correct percentage, making option D the right answer.\n\nSo, to recap: The correlation coefficient r = 0.9 indicates a strong positive relationship, but the percentage of variation explained is r\u00b2, which is 81%. Therefore, option D is the correct conclusion.\n</think>\n\nThe correct answer is [ D ].\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Understanding Correlation (r = 0.9):** A correlation of 0.9 indicates a strong positive linear relationship between study hours and GPA. This means that as study hours increase, GPA tends to increase as well.\n\n2. **Interpreting the Correlation Coefficient (r):** The value of r (0.9) measures the strength of the linear relationship. However, it does not directly indicate the percentage of variation explained. To find the percentage of variation, we square the correlation coefficient.\n\n3. **Calculating the Percentage of Variation (r\u00b2):** \n   - r = 0.9\n   - r\u00b2 = (0.9)\u00b2 = 0.81\n   - 0.81 represents 81%.\n\n4. **Evaluating the Options:**\n   - **Option C** claims 90% of variation, which is higher than the actual 81%, so it's incorrect.\n   - **Option D** correctly states that 81% of variation in GPAs can be explained by study hours, making it the right choice.\n\n**Answer:** [ D ]"
