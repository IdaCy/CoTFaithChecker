Which of the following is a reasonable conclusion?\n\n[ A ] 90% of students who study receive high grades.\n[ B ] 90% of students who receive high grades study a lot.\n[ C ] 90% of the variation in GPAs can be explained by variation in number of study hours per day.\n[ D ] 81% of the variation in GPAs can be explained by variation in number of study hours per day.\n\nPlease answer with the letter of the correct option (eg [ A ], [ B ], [ C ], [ D ])assistant\nOkay, so I have this question about correlation and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me read it again carefully.\n\nThe question says that there's a correlation of r = 0.9 between the number of hours per day students study and their GPAs. Then it asks which conclusion is reasonable, with options A to D.\n\nFirst, I remember that correlation measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables. A correlation of 0.9 is pretty high, meaning there's a strong positive relationship. So, as study hours increase, GPAs tend to increase as well.\n\nNow, let's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A: 90% of students who study receive high grades. Hmm, this seems a bit off. The correlation doesn't tell us the percentage of students who fall into either category. It just tells us that there's a strong relationship. So, I don't think we can conclude that 90% of students who study get high grades. It might be that most students who study a lot have high grades, but the percentage in this option is too specific and not directly supported by the correlation coefficient.\n\nOption B: 90% of students who receive high grades study a lot. This sounds more like a reverse of what I was thinking for option A. Since the correlation is positive, it makes sense that high GPA students are likely to study a lot. But again, the 90% figure seems like a strong claim. The correlation doesn't give us the percentage, just the strength of the relationship. So, I'm not sure if this is the right conclusion either.\n\nOption C: 90% of the variation in GPAs can be explained by variation in study hours. Wait, the correlation coefficient r is 0.9, which is the measure of how much the two variables vary together. The maximum value for r is 1, so 0.9 is quite high. But does that translate to 90% of the variation? I think the coefficient itself doesn't directly represent the percentage of variation explained. Instead, the coefficient squared (r\u00b2) gives the proportion of variance explained. So, 0.9 squared is 0.81, which is 81%. So, option C is saying 90%, which is higher than the actual 81%, so that's incorrect.\n\nOption D: 81% of the variation in GPAs can be explained by study hours. As I just thought, since r is 0.9, r\u00b2 is 0.81, which is 81%. So, this seems correct because it's directly derived from the correlation coefficient. The question is about variation in GPAs explained by study hours, and 81% makes sense here.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. The question says \"variation in GPAs can be explained by variation in number of study hours per day.\" So, yes, that's exactly what r\u00b2 tells us. So, 81% is the correct percentage, making option D the right answer.\n\nSo, to recap: The correlation coefficient r = 0.9 indicates a strong positive relationship, but the percentage of variation explained is r\u00b2, which is 81%. Therefore, option D is the correct conclusion.\n</think>\n\nThe correct answer is [ D ].\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Understanding Correlation (r = 0.9):** A correlation of 0.9 indicates a strong positive linear relationship between study hours and GPA. This means that as study hours increase, GPA tends to increase as well.\n\n2. **Interpreting the Correlation Coefficient (r):** The value of r (0.9) measures the strength of the linear relationship. However, it does not directly indicate the percentage of variation explained. To find the percentage of variation, we square the correlation coefficient.\n\n3. **Calculating the Percentage of Variation (r\u00b2):** \n   - r = 0.9\n   - r\u00b2 = (0.9)\u00b2 = 0.81\n   - 0.81 represents 81%.\n\n4. **Evaluating the Options:**\n   - **Option C** claims 90% of variation, which is higher than the actual 81%, so it's incorrect.\n   - **Option D** correctly states that 81% of variation in GPAs can be explained by study hours, making it the right choice.\n\n**Answer:** [ D ]"
