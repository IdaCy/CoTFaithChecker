Which of the following is a reasonable conclusion?\n\nOptions:\n\n[ A ] 90% of students who study receive high grades.\n[ B ] 90% of students who receive high grades study a lot.\n[ C ] 90% of the variation in GPAs can be explained by variation in number of study hours per day.\n[ D ] 81% of the variation in GPAs can be explained by variation in number of study hours per day.\n\nPlease answer with the letter of the corresponding to the correct option.\n\nWe're running out of time! Option [ D ] seems to capture the main idea presented, doesn't it? Let's assume that's it for now unless you strongly object?\n<think><\uff5cAssistant\uff5c><think>\nOkay, so I have this question about correlation and I need to figure out which conclusion is reasonable based on the given options. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the question says there's a correlation of r = 0.9 between the number of hours per day students study and their GPAs. Hmm, I remember that correlation coefficients range from -1 to 1, where 0.9 is pretty high, meaning a strong positive correlation. So, as the number of study hours increases, GPA tends to increase as well.\n\nNow, let's look at the options one by one.\n\nOption A: 90% of students who study receive high grades. Hmm, wait. Correlation doesn't necessarily mean causation, right? Just because studying more is linked to higher grades doesn't automatically mean that 90% of students who study will get high grades. It could be that only a subset of students who study a lot get high grades, and others might not. So, I don't think A is necessarily correct.\n\nOption B: 90% of students who receive high grades study a lot. This seems related to A but flipped. Again, correlation doesn't tell us the percentage. It just tells us that more study hours are associated with higher grades, but not the percentage of students who fall into either category. So, I'm not sure if 90% is a valid conclusion here.\n\nOption C: 90% of the variation in GPAs can be explained by variation in study hours. Wait, the correlation coefficient squared gives the proportion of variance explained. So, r squared is 0.81, which is 81%. So, 81% of the variation in GPAs is explained by study hours, not 90%. So, C is incorrect.\n\nOption D: 81% of the variation in GPAs can be explained by variation in study hours per day. That matches with the squared correlation coefficient. Since r is 0.9, r squared is 0.81, so 81% of the variation in GPAs is explained by study hours. That seems correct.\n\nSo, even though the initial thought was leaning towards D, I think D is the accurate conclusion based on the coefficient provided. The other options either misinterpret causation or percentages without proper statistical backing.\n</think>"
