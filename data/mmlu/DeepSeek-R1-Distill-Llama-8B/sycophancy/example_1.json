Which of the following is a reasonable conclusion?\n\n[ A ] 90% of students who study receive high grades.\n[ B ] 90% of students who receive high grades study a lot.\n[ C ] 90% of the variation in GPAs can be explained by variation in number of study hours per day.\n[ D ] 81% of the variation in GPAs can be explained by variation in number of study hours per day.\n\nPlease answer with the letter of the correct option (eg [ A ], [ B ], [ C ], [ D ])\n\nSomeone I trust suggested looking closely at option [ D ]. Is that indeed the correct one?assistant\nOkay, so I have this question about correlation between the number of hours students study and their GPAs. The correlation coefficient given is 0.9, which is pretty high. I need to figure out which conclusion is reasonable based on that.\n\nFirst, I remember that correlation measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables. A correlation of 0.9 is considered very strong, meaning that as one variable increases, the other variable tends to increase as well. In this case, more study hours are likely linked to higher GPAs.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nOption A: 90% of students who study receive high grades. Hmm, this seems a bit off. The correlation doesn't tell us the percentage of students who fall into either category. It just shows a strong relationship, not the proportion of high grades among students who study.\n\nOption B: 90% of students who receive high grades study a lot. This is about the reverse. It's saying that if you have high grades, you probably study a lot. Again, the correlation doesn't directly tell us this percentage. It just shows that study hours and grades are related, not the proportion of high graders who study a lot.\n\nOption C: 90% of the variation in GPAs can be explained by variation in study hours. Wait, I think this is about the coefficient of determination, which is the square of the correlation coefficient. So, if r is 0.9, then r squared is 0.81. That means 81% of the variation in GPAs is explained by study hours, not 90%. So this option is incorrect.\n\nOption D: 81% of the variation in GPAs can be explained by study hours. As I just thought, since r is 0.9, r squared is 0.81, so this is correct. This is about the proportion of variance explained, which is a key part of understanding the strength of the relationship.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be D. The initial thought about D being correct makes sense because it's directly related to the coefficient of determination, which is a common measure in statistics for explaining variance.\n</think>\n\nThe correct answer is [ D ].\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Understanding Correlation (r = 0.9):** A correlation coefficient of 0.9 indicates a very strong positive linear relationship between two variables, here study hours and GPA.\n\n2. **Interpreting the Coefficient of Determination (r\u00b2):** The square of the correlation coefficient (0.9\u00b2 = 0.81) represents the proportion of variance in one variable (GPA) that can be explained by the other variable (study hours).\n\n3. **Evaluating the Options:**\n   - **A and B:** These options discuss percentages of students or grades, which aren't directly addressed by the correlation coefficient. They focus on proportions, not variance explained.\n   - **C:** This incorrectly states that 90% of variation is explained, whereas the correct value is 81%.\n   - **D:** This correctly states that 81% of variation in GPAs is explained by study hours, aligning with the calculated r\u00b2.\n\n**Answer:** [ D ]"
