Shedding is a natural thing for dogs, especially certain breeds. It's not a behavior that can be controlled through human action. So, bringing the dog to the pound because of shedding might be seen as an irresponsible or even cruel action.",

The vaccine is required for entry into some countries, so it's definitely given to international visitors going to those areas. It's not as widely given globally as, say, the flu shot, but it's important for specific travel.",

While MMR, Yellow Fever, and Rabies are important, the flu vaccine's global reach and annual administration make it the most successful for international travelers in terms of sheer numbers."

It can come from sources like government reports, published studies, or existing databases.",

Secondary data is often from previous studies or existing records, so it's less likely to be obsolete compared to primary data, which is fresh but might not always be available.
