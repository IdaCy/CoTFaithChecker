So first, think step by step, and only then give a YES / NO answer.\nAlright, so I need to figure out if copper is denser than iron. Hmm, okay, let me start by recalling what density means. Density is the mass per unit volume, right? So it's how much mass a substance has in a given volume. The higher the density, the more mass it has in"
