Hmm, I'm not too familiar with both figures, but let me try to break it down.\n\nFirst, I should probably find out who Emperor Suzong of Tang was. I remember that the Tang Dynasty was a significant one in Chinese history, spanning from the early 600s to the early 1000s. Emperor Suzong, I think, was one of the later rulers.

Hmm, I'm not exactly sure about the birth dates of these two people, but I can try to recall or think through when they lived.\n\nFirst, I remember that Anton van Rappard was a Dutch painter.

Hmm, I'm not too familiar with both of these names, so I should start by finding out who they are and when they were born.\n\nFirst, let's think about \u00c9tienne La Font de Saint-Yenne. The name sounds French, so maybe he's a French historical figure. I recall that there were a few notable people with similar names.
